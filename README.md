# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview
This analysis was conducted in order to better understand the Pewlett-Hackard workforce and to determine what needs Pewlett-Hackard may haver regarding replacing the upcoming "silver tsunami" of the baby-boomer generation retirements.

## Results
Below are 4 observations from the "silver tsunami" analysis

1) The analysis indicated we have over 90,000 active employees at Pewlett-Hackard who are nearing retirement (born between 1952 and 1955)
2) The retiring group includes a high number of senior employees as well as leaders and managers. Over 57,000 senior staff and engineers are in this group as well 4500 technique leaders and managers

3) We have about 1500 eligible employees who we can ask to help mentor new and younger employees to better prepare them for their roles
4) While we have a number of eligible mentors, we still have significantly more employees who are close to retirement, therefore we must either loosen our mentorship eligibilty conditions to increase the number of eligible mentors or we must assign the eligible mentors in the program to numerous new hires to help bridge the gap.
