# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Database Management

## Overview
This analysis was conducted in order to better understand the Pewlett-Hackard workforce and to determine what needs Pewlett-Hackard may haver regarding replacing the upcoming "silver tsunami" of the baby-boomer generation retirements.

## Results
Below are 4 observations from the "silver tsunami" analysis

1) The analysis indicated we have over 90,000 active employees at Pewlett-Hackard who are nearing retirement (born between 1952 and 1955)

3) The retiring group includes a high number of senior employees as well as leaders and managers. Over 57,000 senior staff and engineers are in this group as well 4500 technique leaders and managers

3) We have about 1500 eligible employees who we can ask to help mentor new and younger employees to better prepare them for their roles

4) While we have a number of eligible mentors, we still have significantly more employees who are close to retirement, therefore we must either loosen our mentorship eligibilty conditions to increase the number of eligible mentors or we must assign the eligible mentors in the program to numerous new hires to help bridge the gap.

## Summary
Our analysis determined that Pewlett-Hackard has a high number of senior staff and engineers who are on the cusp of retirement which will require a significant amount of new employees to replace these roles. In order to best prepare new hires for their roles we have created a new mentorship program which will allow employees who have a significant amount of experience to share their knowledge and insight with new PH employees. This program will be eligible to active employees who were born between 1962 and 1966 and will offer them incentives for their participation in the program. By increasing our eligible mentors in the program we were able to better meet the rising hiring demand PH will endure due to the upcoming "Silver Tsunami."
